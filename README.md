## Optimization Problems and Applications

This project was done during my JRF with Prof. Nitin Padhiyar at IIT Gandhinagar. I implemented ~25 optimization problems of various types including LP, QP etc. All the details are listed in the [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-dSTJ151z6ZOA6hW8BGMmaq5Sx0Ex54y/view?usp=sharing). I was asked to implement the problems in both Matlab and Excel (one of the weird requirements ðŸ˜…). Thus, I have provided all the solutions using both [Matlab](Matlab_Files/) and [Excel](Excel_Files/).

### Requirements
1. Matlab
2. [Opti Toolbox](https://github.com/jonathancurrie/OPTI)
